# note-taker
Hi! My name is Josh. Welcome to my note taker. 

[Here is a link to my deployed website, check it out!](https://nameless-caverns-84693.herokuapp.com/)

The note taker is very simple fill out the header/ tittle and the note/ paragraph under. After that, in the top right corner click the save file. If you want any more notes press the delete button and all your notes will be removed.

Most of my additions made were in the `server.js` file. I did have to also add everything needed to for npm's. The server.js file was for building back end operations. Aside from that everything was given to me from my instructor.

Thank you for taking your time to look at my code and giving feed back. Have a nice day!
